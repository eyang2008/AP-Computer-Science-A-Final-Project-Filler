Final Project for AP Computer Science A, 2024

Filler
A four-player game. Every round, one player picks a color, one that is not picked by the other players. 
You claim boxes with picking those colors. 
For example, if you were originally green, an opponent was red, and there was a purple square next to you. 
If you chose the purple, you would claim the purple square next to you. 
The purpose of the game is to claim as many squares as possible.
